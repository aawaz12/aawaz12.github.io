I am a Ph.D. researcher in Biophysics at Georgia Tech, specializing
in biofilm dynamics and growth. My work integrates theoretical
and experimental methods to develop a mathematical framework
for emergent biological phenomena. I have extensive experience
in modeling and simulations. Beyond my research, I am deeply
committed to mentorship, having supervised and guided
undergraduate students in their research projects
